          <p>
            I decided to kick off a project that really shows what I'm learning.
            I've found it a bit challenging to remember all the little details
            in HTML & CSS, but I'm determined to nail it. This month, I'm not
            just updating this journal—I’m finally planning to start adding my
            projects to GitHub and fully dive into web development. I'm thinking
            of starting small and building on the skills I picked up from my
            Java and Machine Learning days.
            <br /><br />
            So far, I've built a simple Counter. It was really fun getting back
            into daily coding, though I know there's still a lot to learn in JS.
            <br /><br />
            Really like the way this journal has turned out so far. I was
            thinking of maybe adding a comment section or <b>emoji reactions</b>
            similar to what Discord has for messages, but I probably won't be
            able to do it right now. It's something I'm looking forward to
            trying.
