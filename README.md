# Tomas' Journal

Tomas' Journal is a personal web-based journal where I track my progress in web development and other projects. The purpose of this project is to document the things I am learning, build simple web projects, and keep a record of my growth as a developer.

## Features

- **Simple Journal Entries**: Write, read, and track your learning journey.
- **Date and Notes**: Each entry includes the date and your notes about the progress.
- **Responsive Design**: The journal is designed to be simple and responsive across devices.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations when adding new journal entries.
- **GitHub Integration**: Quick access to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/TomasK24) through a clickable icon.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the journal content.
- **CSS**: For styling the journal, including custom animations and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: (Future plans to add interactivity) to make the journal more dynamic.
- **Font Awesome**: For including a GitHub icon.
